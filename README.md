# Detecting Malicious URL with Machine Learning in Python

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting malicious URLs using machine learning techniques. It leverages data preprocessing and vectorization with `TfidVectorizer` and applies a machine learning model to classify URLs as malicious or benign.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, splitting, and removal of repeated patterns in URLs.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use of TF-IDF Vectorizer for text-based feature extraction.
- **Model Training**: Application of machine learning algorithms for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Performance analysis using appropriate metrics.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/detect-malicious-url.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd detect-malicious-url
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Detecting\ Malicious\ URL\ Cyber\ Security.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
